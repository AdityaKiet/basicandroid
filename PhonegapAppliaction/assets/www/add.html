<h2><b>ADDITION:</b></h2><br><p>
In the convention process we perform the process as follows.<br><br>
234 + 403 + 564 + 721<br><br>
write as 234<br>
403<br>
564<br>
721<br><br><p>
<b>Step (i):</b> 4 + 3 + 4 + 1 = 12 <br>
2 retained and 1 is carried over to left.<br><br>
<b>Step (ii):</b> 3 + 0 + 6 + 2 = 11 the carried '1' is added<br>
i.e., Now 2 retained as digit in the second place (from right to left) of the answer and 1 is carried over to left.<br><br>
<b>step (iii):</b> 2 + 4 + 5 + 7 = 18<br>
carried over '1' is added<br>
i.e., 18 + 1 = 19. As the addition process ends, the same 19 is retained in the left had most part of the answer.<br><br>
thus
234 + 403 + 564 + 721 = 1922 is the answer<br><br>
we follow sudhikaran process Recall 'sudha' i.e., dot (.) is taken as an upa-sutra (No: 15)<br>

<b>
Steps :</b>
<br><br><b>(i)</b> 2 + 6 = 8, 8 + 4 = 12 so a dot on 4 and 2 + 7 = 9 the answer retained under column (i)<br><br>
<b>(ii)</b> One dot from column (i) treated as 1, is carried over to column (ii),<br> thus 1 + 6 = 7, 7 + 8 = 15 A' dot';<br> 
is placed on 8 for the 1 in 15 and the 5 in 15 is added to 2 above.<br><br>
5 + 2 = 7, 7 + 3 = 10 <br>i.e. 0 is written under column (ii) and a dot for the carried over 1 of
10 is placed on the top of 3.<br><br>
<b>(iii)</b> The number of dots counted in column (iii) are 2.<br><br>
Hence the number 2 is carried over to column (ii) Now in column (iii)<br>
2 + 1 = 3, 3 + 5 = 8, 8 + 6 = 14 <br>A dot for 1 on the number 6 and 4 is retained to be added
4 above to give 8. <br>Thus 8 is placed under column (iii).<br><br>
<b>(iv)</b> Finally the number of dots in column (iii) are counted. <br>It is '1' only.<br> So it carried over to
1000th place. <br>As there is no fourth column 1 is the answer for 4th column. <br>Thus the answer
is 1809.<br><br>

<h2><b>SUBTRACTION:</b></h2><br><p>
The 'Sudha' Sutra is applicable where the larger digit is to be subtracted from the smaller digit. 
<br><br>

<b>Procedure:</b><br>
(i) If the digit to be subtracted is larger, a dot ( sudha ) is given to its left.<br><br>
(ii) The purak of this lower digit is added to the upper digit or purak-rekhank of this lower digit is subtracted.<br><br>
Let us go to the process through the example.<br><br>
